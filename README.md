## Introduction

* **ReasonLite is an ultra-lightweight math reasoning model.** With only 0.6B parameters, it leverages **high-quality data distillation** to achieve performance comparable to models over 10× its size, such as Qwen3-8B, **reaching 75.2 on AIME24 and extending the scaling law of small models.**
* The project is fully open-source, including **model weights**, **training scripts**, **training data**, and the **data synthesis + filtering pipeline**.

## Model

The model is trained in **two progressive distillation stages**.
First, short-CoT data is used to distill **Qwen3-0.6B** into **ReasonLite-0.6B-Turbo**, improving **AIME24 accuracy from 11.0 → 57.1**.
Then, long-CoT data is used to obtain **ReasonLite-0.6B**, further boosting accuracy to **75.2**.

**Evaluation Results**: We evaluate model performance on math reasoning tasks.  
- **avg@16**: The average accuracy over 16 independently generated answers.  
- **pass@8**: The probability that at least one correct answer appears among 8 generated samples.

## Dataset

* A total of **343K math problems** originated from [Polaris](https://huggingface.co/datasets/POLARIS-Project/Polaris-Dataset-53K) and [OpenMathReasoning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenMathReasoning).
* Using the **GPT-OSS** model as the teacher, **9.1M** model-generated raw answers were collected under both medium and high reasoning modes.
* Pseudo-labels are created by majority voting over the model outputs.
* Finally, **6.1M samples** were retained, including **4.3M medium-level** and **1.8M high-level** reasoning data.

## Setup Environment

Docker:

```bash
# Recommended ROCm Docker
rocm/vllm-dev:open-mi300-08052025

# Recommended CUDA Docker (latest vLLM)
docker.io/vllm/vllm-openai:latest
```

Install Python packages for data synthesis and evaluation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Training

This project uses [open-r1](https://github.com/huggingface/open-r1?tab=readme-ov-file#sft-distillation) as the training codebase, but you can use any other training framework as well.
Below are example launch scripts and YAML configurations used in our experiments.

```
# Stage 1 SFT

# Example training script:
train/stage1.sh

# Example YAML config:
train/config_stage1.yaml


# Stage 2 SFT

# Example training script:
train/stage2.sh

# Example YAML config:
train/config_stage2.yaml
```

### Training on a single 8xH100 node (paratera_train cluster)

The training stack runs on one 8xH100 node with a single global batch of 256
(`per_device_train_batch_size=32` x `gradient_accumulation_steps=1` x 8 GPUs),
DeepSpeed ZeRO-1, and FlashAttention-3 (H100-optimized). Dependencies are
installed at runtime on top of the `infra/nvidia-pytorch` base image; open-r1
is cloned and wired into the recipe tree automatically — no custom image build
is required.

All cluster coordinates and shared-storage paths live in `train/setup_env.sh`
(the single source of truth); edit them there, not in the launch scripts.

```
# Smoke test (3 steps, no checkpoint) — verifies memory and path wiring:
bash train/launch_h100.sh smoke stage1

# Full training run:
bash train/launch_h100.sh full stage2
```

Submit via `cctl` (see `train/setup_env.sh` for the authoritative cluster /
pool / billing / image values):

```bash
cctl job create \
  --project "$CCTL_PROJECT" --cluster "$CCTL_CLUSTER" \
  --resource-pool "$CCTL_RESOURCE_POOL" --billing-account-id "$CCTL_BILLING" \
  --image "$CCTL_IMAGE" --gpu-model "$CCTL_GPU_MODEL" --priority "$CCTL_PRIORITY" \
  --gpu "$CCTL_GPU_COUNT" --cpu "$CCTL_CPU" --memory "$CCTL_MEMORY" \
  --entry "bash $REASONLITE_REPO_ROOT/train/launch_h100.sh smoke stage1"
```

> Note: `per_device_train_batch_size=32` with `max_length=32768` is memory-
> aggressive. The smoke run exists to surface an OOM before committing to a
> full run; if it OOMs, lower `per_device_train_batch_size` (and raise
> `gradient_accumulation_steps` to keep the global batch at 256) or enable
> `packing: true` in the stage config.

## Model Evaluation

Example for evaluating **ReasonLite-0.6B on AIME24**. The evaluation scripts are based on [DeepMath](https://github.com/zwhe99/DeepMath).

```bash
cd eval
python3 start.py -c config/eval.yaml
```

## Data Generation Pipeline

You will need to edit the configuration file `config/oss.yaml`, or create a new one based on your own needs.
Then you may run through the full pipeline as follows.

### Start vLLM Server

```bash
python3 vllm_start.py -c config/oss.yaml
```

### Synthetic Data

**Generate model answers**

```bash
python3 infer.py -c config/oss.yaml -m infer
```

### Pseudo-Labels via Voting (Optional)

**Obtain pseudo-labels through majority voting**

```bash
python3 infer.py -c config/oss.yaml -m vote
```

### Judging Answer Correctness

**Judge correctness using provided labels**

```bash
python3 infer.py -c config/oss.yaml -m judge
```

**Judge correctness using pseudo-labels** (requires running `vote` first)

```bash
python3 infer.py -c config/oss.yaml -m judge_vote
```

### Filtering and Converting to Training Format

**Filter out incorrect solutions and convert the correct ones to training format.**
Specify the path to the judged data:

```bash
python3 utils/saving_to_training_format.py -d path/to/judged/data.jsonl
```

### Directory Structure for Data Storage

```
datas/
└── <experiment_name>/
    ├── info.jsonl           # input prompts
    ├── answer_origin/       # raw generations
    │   └── <timestamp>/
    │       └── 0_1.jsonl
    ├── answer_judge/        # judged generations
    │   └── <timestamp>/
    │       └── 0_1.jsonl
    ├── vote/                # majority votes per prompt
    │   └── <timestamp>/
    │       └── 0_1.jsonl
    └── answer_judge_vote/   # judged using vote labels
        └── <timestamp>/
            └── 0_1.jsonl
```

### JSONL Examples

#### info.jsonl

The files `info.jsonl` and `vote/<timestamp>/0_1.jsonl` follow this format:

```jsonl
{
    "prompt": "Solve the equation (x^2 - x - 2 = 0).",
    "expected_answer": "5",
    "index": "pol:0",
    "vote": {"x=2,-1": 5, "x=2": 1}  // Only in vote/<timestamp>/0_1.jsonl
}
```

* `prompt` contains the math problem
* `expected_answer` is the ground-truth label
* `index` is the global ID using the format `"dataset_name:index"`
* `vote` shows the voting results (only in vote files)

#### Intermediate Result JSONL

Files under
`answer_origin/<timestamp>/0_1.jsonl`,
`answer_judge/<timestamp>/0_1.jsonl`,
`answer_judge_vote/<timestamp>/0_1.jsonl`
follow this format:

```jsonl
{
    "info": "<input info from info.jsonl>",
    "index": "pol:0_3",
    "model_input": "<full input ...>",
    "model_output": "<full output with input prepended ...>",
    "prompt": "The front tires of a car wear out after 25,000 km, ...",
    "answer": "<model output ...>",
    "judge": true  // Only in answer_judge and answer_judge_vote
}
```

* Files under `answer_origin` contain raw model trajectories
* `answer_judge` and `answer_judge_vote` add the boolean `judge` flag indicating correctness
